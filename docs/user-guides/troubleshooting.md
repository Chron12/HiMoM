# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you fix common problems when using PreRollTracker. Start by finding your problem in the list below, then follow the steps to fix it.

## "I Can't Log In"

If you cannot log into the app, work through these steps in order.

### Check #1: Are You Using the Right Address?

1. Look at the address bar at the top of your browser.
2. Make sure it says **himomstats.online** -- nothing extra, no typos.
3. If the address is wrong, clear it and type **himomstats.online** again, then press **Enter** or **Go**.

### Check #2: Is Your Password Correct?

1. The password is case-sensitive. That means "Harvest" and "harvest" and "HARVEST" are all different passwords. Type it exactly as you were given it.
2. Check if **Caps Lock** is on. Look at your keyboard for a Caps Lock light (usually on the left side of the keyboard). If it is on, press the **Caps Lock** key to turn it off, then try again.
3. On a phone, make sure your phone's autocorrect or auto-capitalize is not changing the password. Try typing slowly and checking each letter.

### Check #3: Try a Different Browser

1. If you are using Chrome, try Safari (or the other way around).
2. Sometimes a browser can have corrupted data that prevents logging in.

### Check #4: Clear Your Browser's Saved Data

Sometimes old data in your browser can cause login problems.

#### On Chrome (Computer)
1. Click the **three dots** in the top-right corner of Chrome.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Click **Privacy and security** on the left side.
4. Click **Clear browsing data**.
5. Make sure "Cookies and other site data" is checked.
6. Click **Clear data**.
7. Go back to **himomstats.online** and try logging in again.

#### On Safari (iPhone/iPad)
1. Open the **Settings** app on your phone (the gray gear icon, not the Safari app).
2. Scroll down and tap **Safari**.
3. Scroll down and tap **Clear History and Website Data**.
4. Tap **Clear** to confirm.
5. Open Safari and go to **himomstats.online** again.

#### On Chrome (Android Phone)
1. Open Chrome and tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner.
2. Tap **Settings**.
3. Tap **Privacy and security**.
4. Tap **Clear browsing data**.
5. Make sure "Cookies and site data" is checked.
6. Tap **Clear data**.
7. Go to **himomstats.online** and try logging in again.

### Check #5: Is the Website Down?

1. Try going to any other website (like google.com) to confirm your internet is working.
2. If other websites work but himomstats.online does not, the site may be temporarily down for maintenance. Wait 15-30 minutes and try again.
3. If the problem continues, contact your supervisor.

### If Nothing Works
Contact your supervisor and let them know:
- What browser you are using (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
- What device you are using (iPhone, Android, computer)
- What error message you see (take a screenshot if you can)

## "My Counts Didn't Save"

If you entered production counts but they do not seem to have saved, follow these steps.

### Check #1: Verify the Counts

1. Go back to the **Production Dashboard**.
2. Find the batch you were updating.
3. Click or tap on it to open the Edit Batch page.
4. Look at the count fields (0.5g, 0.7g, 1.0g). Do the numbers match what you entered?

### Check #2: Check Your Internet Connection

Counts are saved to the server over the internet. If your connection drops, the save may fail.

1. Look at the Wi-Fi or cell signal icon on your device. Is it showing a connection?
2. Try loading another page or website. If nothing loads, your internet is down.
3. Once your internet is back, go to the Edit Batch page and re-enter your counts.

### Check #3: Did You See an Error Message?

If the system could not save your counts, it may have shown a brief error message (a small popup or banner at the top or bottom of the screen). Common errors include:
- **"Network error"** -- Your internet connection dropped.
- **"Batch not found"** -- The batch may have been archived or deleted by someone else.
- **"Invalid value"** -- You may have typed something that is not a number (like a letter or symbol).

### Check #4: Re-enter the Counts

1. Open the Edit Batch page for the batch.
2. Enter your current total counts again.
3. Watch for a confirmation that the save was successful (the page may show updated totals, or you may see a brief success message).

### How to Prevent This

- **Keep your device connected to Wi-Fi** when using the app.
- **Update counts frequently** (every 50-100 pre-rolls) rather than entering a big number at the end of the day. This way, if one save fails, you only lose a small amount of data.
- **Refresh the page** after entering counts to confirm they saved.

## "The Page Looks Wrong"

If the page looks strange -- things are overlapping, buttons are missing, colors are wrong, or the layout is broken -- try these fixes.

### Fix #1: Refresh the Page

1. On a computer, press **F5** on your keyboard, or press **Ctrl+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+R** (Mac).
2. On a phone, pull down from the top of the page to refresh, or tap the refresh button in the address bar.

### Fix #2: Hard Refresh (Clear the Cache)

A "hard refresh" forces the browser to reload everything from scratch instead of using saved copies.

#### On Chrome (Computer)
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac).

#### On Safari (Mac)
1. Press **Cmd+Option+R**.

#### On a Phone
1. Clear the browser cache (see the "I Can't Log In" section above for instructions on clearing browsing data).
2. Then reload the page.

### Fix #3: Check Your Browser Zoom

Sometimes the page looks wrong because you accidentally zoomed in or out.

1. On a computer, press **Ctrl+0** (Windows) or **Cmd+0** (Mac) to reset the zoom to 100%.
2. On a phone, double-tap the page or pinch with two fingers to reset the zoom.

### Fix #4: Try a Different Browser

If the page still looks wrong after refreshing and clearing the cache:
1. Open a different browser (for example, Chrome instead of Safari).
2. Go to **himomstats.online** and see if the page looks correct there.
3. If it works in a different browser, the problem is with your original browser. You can continue using the other browser, or try clearing all data from the original browser.

## "I See an Error Message"

Here are common error messages and what to do about them.

### "Session expired" or "Please log in"

Your login session has ended (after 30 days, or if you cleared your browser data).

**Fix:**
1. You will be redirected to the login page.
2. Enter the password and click **Login**.
3. Make sure the **"Remember me for 30 days"** checkbox is checked so this happens less often.

### "An internal error occurred"

Something went wrong on the server side. This is not your fault.

**Fix:**
1. Wait 30 seconds and try your action again.
2. If it keeps happening, refresh the page and try again.
3. If the error keeps coming back, contact your supervisor. Tell them what you were trying to do when the error appeared.

### "Batch not found"

The batch you were trying to view or edit no longer exists (it may have been deleted or archived).

**Fix:**
1. Go back to the **Production Dashboard** and look for the batch there.
2. If the batch is not on the dashboard, check the **Archive** page -- it may have been archived.
3. If you still cannot find it, ask your supervisor.

### "Invalid value" or "Invalid JSON"

You entered something the system did not understand.

**Fix:**
1. Check that you entered a number where a number is expected (not letters, symbols, or empty fields).
2. Make sure there are no extra spaces or special characters in your input.
3. Try entering the value again.

### "File too large (max 16 MB)"

You tried to upload a file that is too big.

**Fix:**
1. Reduce the file size. For images, try taking a smaller photo. For CSV files, split them into smaller files.
2. Try uploading again.

### "Only X units available"

You tried to create a wholesale hold for more units than are available.

**Fix:**
1. Check how many units are actually available for that SKU.
2. Enter a quantity that is equal to or less than the available amount.
3. If you need more units than are available, talk to your supervisor.

## "The App Is Slow"

If pages take a long time to load or actions feel sluggish, try these steps.

### Check Your Internet Connection

1. Open a speed test website (search for "internet speed test" in your browser) to check your connection speed.
2. If your speed is very low (under 5 Mbps), the app will be slow. Try moving closer to the Wi-Fi router or switching to a different network.

### Close Other Tabs and Apps

1. If you have many browser tabs open, close the ones you are not using. Each open tab uses memory and can slow things down.
2. On a phone, close other apps running in the background.

### Refresh the Page

1. Sometimes the page gets slow after being open for a long time. A simple refresh (press **F5** or pull down on your phone) can speed things up.

### Use the Installed App Version

If you installed PreRollTracker as a phone app (see the Getting Started guide), it may run faster than using it in the browser because it has less overhead.

### Try a Different Time

If the internet at your workplace is shared with many people, it may be slower during busy times. The app itself does not have peak hours, but your internet might.

## "I Forgot My Password"

If you cannot remember the password, here is how to reset it.

### Using a Recovery Key

A recovery key is a special code that looks like **HARVEST-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX** (with letters and numbers instead of the X's). If you or your supervisor set up a recovery key previously, you can use it to reset the password.

1. On the login page, click the **"Forgot password?"** link below the Login button.
2. You will see the **Password Recovery** page.
3. Type your recovery key in the box. It looks like **HARVEST-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX**. Type it exactly, including the dashes.
4. Click the **Verify Key** button.
5. If the key is correct, you will be taken to the **Set New Password** page.
6. Type your new password in the **New Password** field. It must be at least 6 characters long.
7. Type the same password again in the **Confirm Password** field.
8. Click **Reset Password**.
9. You will see a **new recovery key** displayed on the screen. **WRITE THIS DOWN IMMEDIATELY.** This new key replaces the old one and will not be shown again.
10. Click **Go to Login** and log in with your new password.

### If You Do Not Have a Recovery Key

If no recovery key was set up, the Password Recovery page will tell you: "No recovery key configured."

In this case:
1. Contact your supervisor or system administrator.
2. They can reset the password using a special command on the server.
3. After they reset it, they will give you a new password and a new recovery key.

### Important Notes About Recovery Keys

- **Save your recovery key in a safe place** as soon as you see it. Write it on paper and put it somewhere secure, or save it in a password manager.
- **Each time you reset your password, you get a new recovery key.** The old one stops working.
- **If you lose both the password and the recovery key**, only the system administrator can help. There is no other way to get back in.

## How to Get Help

If none of the steps above solve your problem, here is how to get help:

### Step 1: Take a Screenshot

Before contacting anyone, take a screenshot of what you see on screen. This helps whoever is helping you understand the problem.

- **On an iPhone:** Press the **Side button** and **Volume Up button** at the same time.
- **On an Android phone:** Press the **Power button** and **Volume Down button** at the same time.
- **On a Windows computer:** Press the **PrtScn** (Print Screen) key, then paste into an email or message.
- **On a Mac:** Press **Cmd+Shift+3** to capture the whole screen, or **Cmd+Shift+4** to capture a selected area.

### Step 2: Note What You Were Doing

Write down or remember:
- What page you were on
- What button you clicked or what action you were trying to do
- What happened (or did not happen)
- Any error message you saw

### Step 3: Contact Your Supervisor

Give them your screenshot and description. They can:
- Check the system for issues
- Reset your password if needed
- Contact the system administrator for server-level problems

### Step 4: Try Again Later

Many issues are temporary (internet outages, server maintenance). If your supervisor confirms there is a known issue, wait and try again later.

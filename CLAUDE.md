# Excel Health Documentation Project

## Purpose
This project creates comprehensive documentation for two related applications:
- **PreRollTracker** (source: ~/PycharmProjects/PreRollTracker) — Production tracking for pre-roll cannabis manufacturing, live at himomstats.online
- **ApexAPI** (source: ~/PycharmProjects/ApexAPI) — Companion API/application

You have READ access to both project directories. Explore them thoroughly.

## Output Format
All documents must be in `.docx` (Google Docs compatible) or `.xlsx` (Google Sheets compatible) format.
Use `python-docx` and `openpyxl` to generate these programmatically.
Markdown source files (`.md`) should also exist alongside for version control.

## Document Structure
See the swarm prompt for full details on what each tier covers.
